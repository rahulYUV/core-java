    What is a Constructor?
    ----------------------
    A constructor in Java is a special method used to initialize objects.
    It is called when an object of a class is created. 
    Constructors have the same name as the class and do not have a return type.
    
    Characteristics of Constructors:
    - They have the same name as the class.
    - They do not have a return type (not even 'void').
    - They are automatically invoked when an object is created.
    - If no constructor is defined, the Java compiler provides a default constructor.

/* 
    Interview Questions and Answers on Constructors
    -----------------------------------------------
    1. What is a Constructor in Java?
       - A constructor is a special method used to initialize an object automatically
         when an instance of a class is created.

    2. Can a Constructor be 'final', 'static', or 'synchronized'?
       - No, a constructor cannot be 'final', 'static', or 'synchronized'.

    3. Can a Constructor be Overloaded?
       - Yes, constructor overloading is possible in Java by defining multiple constructors
         with different parameter lists.

    4. What is Constructor Chaining?
       - Constructor chaining is calling one constructor from another constructor using 'this()'.

    5. Difference Between Constructor and Method?
       | Feature        | Constructor | Method |
       |---------------|------------|--------|
       | Purpose       | Initializes an object | Performs a task |
       | Return Type   | No return type | Can have a return type |
       | Name          | Same as class | Any valid name |
       | Call          | Called automatically on object creation | Called explicitly |
